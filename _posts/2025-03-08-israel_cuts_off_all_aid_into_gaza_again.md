Since the signing of a ceasefire agreement in January, the Zionist occupation has not stopped its campaign of genocide against Palestine; with repeated violations. Now, the Zionist occupation has banned the entry of all humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip, using systemic starvation as a weapon of genocide against Palestinians.<br><br>

For the last sixteen months, Palestinians have been systemically starved and tortured: deprived of food, medicine, shelter, and all necessities for life. The Zionist entity continues to violate ceasefire agreements and has been unwavering in furthering its genocidal ambitions. The goal of the occupation here is clear: to make life unlivable in Gaza to the West Bank, to continue forced expulsions, and to sever the familial bloodlines of the Palestinian people. The U.S.’s two-party system remains gleefully responsible and complicit.<br><br>

The White House, both political parties, and the media continue to endorse and power this ongoing genocide, intensify forcible transfers, mass incarceration, and the occupation of Palestinians. Zionists and their sympathizers want to condition the people to believe this is “peace” when the genocide hasn’t ended. Genocide remains a central component of Zionism and the Zionist occupation itself. Nothing less than liberation is acceptable, and until that day comes, we will continue to fight.<br><br>

<h1 style="text-align: center;">WHAT CAN WE DO?</h1>
1. Continue to participate in boycotts, direct actions, protests, join anti-imperial revolutionary organizations, coalition build and deepen our political education. <br><br>
2. Support Mutual Aid Programs like MECA that are on the ground in Gaza. <br><br>
3. Recognize that our work involves our collective class consciousness and that Palestine is our North Star to liberation for all oppressed peoples. <br><br>
