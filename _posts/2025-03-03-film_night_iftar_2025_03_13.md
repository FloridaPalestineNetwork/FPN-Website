FPN and CFL SJP present Gaza Movie Night with Iftar‚Äî continuing our 2025 film series with a screening of The Eid Gift. RSVP is required for entry, see details below. The film follows Palestinians in Ramadan 2012 and the following days of Eid Al Fitr - where Israel issued around 400,000 permissions for Palestinians from the West Bank to visit the lost homeland. It was for many the first chance to go ‚Äúinside‚Äù. A story told from a director‚Äôs point of view, the film explores what the gift did to the people.<br><br>

Because Iftar will be provided, we kindly ask that you reserve your spot by 3/9: either by purchasing a ticket or emailing us at floridapalestinenetwork48@gmail.com. This will help us ensure an accurate headcount and minimize food waste. If you‚Äôre unable to purchase a ticket but would still like to attend, please email us to reserve your spot by 3/9. <br><br>

Join us for a Ramadan Iftar as we watch a powerful film, engage in political education, and participate in a community discussion about the Palestinian people‚Äôs resilience and commitment to life-affirming resistance despite Israel‚Äôs ongoing violence and occupation. <br><br>

All ticket proceeds will go to MECA ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π
