2 years and 4 Eids later - Palestinians continue to be ethnically cleansed as Israelâ€™s U.S backed genocide accelerates and the forced starvation remains uninterrupted. While Muslims celebrate Eid across the globe, we demand to push beyond prayers and Duaas. We not only mourn and honor the over 200k Palestinian martyrs, we recommit to the struggle of Palestinian liberation in our lifetime. Free free Palestine. ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¸
