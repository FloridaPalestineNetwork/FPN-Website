<p>Dabke Workshop PART 3: FPN commemorates 2 years of resistance and ongoing genocide and we practice resistance in all forms: protests, political education, and now we invite you to continue to resist with us through the arts. We are proud to partner with Rollins SJP for our workshop 3!<br><br>

The Palestinian traditional folklore dance of Dabke is a cultural form of resistance and continues to be passed down through generations.<br><br>

Once form is complete, we will follow up with you via email to confirm your candidacy in this program, provide address of location and link(s) to pay $25 ahead to reserve your spot. If unable to financially contribute please PM us!<br><br>

FPNâ€™s Impact & Outreach Committee will offer an opportunity to participate in calls to action, engage in political education, and embrace cultural forms of resistance, like Dabke ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¸</p>
