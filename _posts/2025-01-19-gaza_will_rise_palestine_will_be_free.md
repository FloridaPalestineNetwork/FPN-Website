After 470 days of  this accelerated genocide the images we are witnessing coming out of Gaza are a declaration and testament of the defiance and will of the Palestinian resistance over the Zionist regime: from a secured ceasefire to the release of numerous Palestinian political prisoners in the process.<br><br>

Celebrations have finally arrived throughout Palestine, as well as immense mourning for the thousands of Palestinians martyred in this genocide. We recognize that in the shadow of this ceasefire, it arrives at the heavy price of close to 200K Palestinian martyrs, with our beloved people in Gaza forced to bear the ultimate sacrifice; whether it be from systemic bombings, starvation, or torture.<br><br>

Contrary to the claims of the occupation, this victorious and historic triumph has been achieved because of the unending dedication of the Palestinian resistance.<br><br>

It is critical that we do not offer any crumb of political prestige to the very politicians who have powered this accelerated genocide since day one. It is not Trump, nor Biden, nor any cowardly U.S. politician that  made this ceasefire a reality. <br><br>

Gaza is the vanguard of our liberation. <br><br>

The Palestinian  struggle for freedom will only continue to rise. <br><br>

Up until the very hour of this ceasefire — which was deliberately delayed by the Zionist occupation — countless Palestinians were murdered. To the very last breath of this accelerated genocide, the resistance practiced steadfastness and conviction.<br><br>

Only now will Palestinians in Gaza be able to begin the long and painful process of rebuilding. Even with this ceasefire, however, the occupation is still in tact. Gaza remains an open air prison. The West Bank is subjugated to annexation. Mass incarcerations and daily brutalities of the occupation resume. <br><br>

We cannot afford to slow down.<br><br>

Until Palestine is free, our commitment to dismantling these imperial states will continue.<br><br>

As Palestinians in the diaspora and along with our co-strugglers, our dedication in our collective struggle for total liberation only renews.<br><br>
