<p style="text-align: justify;">Born out of Florida Palestine Networkâ€™s critical advocacy and urgent mobilizations in response to the uninterrupted genocide of the Palestinian people: Ditch The Dems offers Florida voters an option outside the current 2 party system that prioritizes devastation instead of the care of its people.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Ditch the Dems is a campaign that aims to mobilize the masses in rejecting the two-party system. We invite our Florida community members, families, and working-class people to join us as we divest from both the Florida Democratic and Republican establishments and to reimagine, re-engage, and redirect resources to mobilize for a world outside duopoly corporations.</p>
