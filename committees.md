<h2><a href="/ditch_the_dems">Ditch The Dems</a></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Born out of Florida Palestine Network’s critical advocacy and urgent mobilizations in response to the uninterrupted genocide of the Palestinian people: Ditch The Dems offers Florida voters an option outside the current 2 party system that prioritizes devastation instead of the care of its people.</p>

<h2><a href="/end_to_genocide_coalition">End To Genocide Coalition</a></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Born out of FPN’s Power Mapping committee, End to Genocide Coalition's duty and message is to build national and local power for the liberation of Palestine and act in solidarity with all peoples oppressed under imperialism and fascism through community and political engagement and direct action. We recognize that those of us living in the belly of the beast have a heightened responsibility to dismantle oppressive systems that are fueling Israel’s genocide and ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian people, and the countless atrocities around the world. We call upon the people of Central Florida to recognize a recurring pattern of Imperial conquest orchestrated by the American government, often veiled under the guise of “Human Rights” and the promotion of Democracy.</p>

<h2><a href="/youth_and_outreach">Youth and Outreach</a></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Youth and Outreach committee aims to engage all people with the culture of Palestine. From teaching Dabka class to working in close solidarity with university students, the Youth and Outreach committee is curial in ensuring Palestinian culture thrives.</p>

<h2><a href="/political_education">Political Education</a></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Florida Palestine Network's Political Education committee is involved in writing all FPN communications and statements. Deeply rooted in theory and praxis, the PE committee strives to bring the light of truth to the darkness of ignorance.</p>
