<p style="text-align: justify;">Founded in 2011, the Florida Palestine Network is a grassroots, intergenerational collective dedicated to confronting and dismantling the systems of complicity that perpetuate Israel’s genocidal violence and occupation of Palestine. We organize in alignment with the global movement for Palestinian liberation, challenging the colonial forces that continue to dispossess, oppress, and dehumanize the Palestinian people.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In Florida, we organize the masses—building a unified front that connects local struggles to the broader fight for freedom. We work to ensure that Palestinians and co-strugglers have the tools and the platform to mobilize, organize, and demand liberation from the chains of settler-colonialism and imperialism.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We reimagine and work toward a world of collective liberation, where the Palestinian people and all oppressed peoples are free. A world without the grip of colonialism, oppression, and capitalist exploitation—a world where the systems of empire that threaten us all are dismantled, and where solidarity becomes the foundation of true freedom for everyone.</p>
